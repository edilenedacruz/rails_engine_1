# Rails Engine

### Project Description

In this project, you will use Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema.

### Learning Goals

* Learn how to to build Single-Responsibility controllers to provide a well-designed and versioned API.
* Learn how to use controller tests to drive your design.
* Use Ruby and ActiveRecord to perform more complicated business intelligence.

#### Dividing the Work

You should create stories divided the following way to make sure both team members get exposure to all major components of the project and are able to hit the learning goals above.

**Record Endpoints**

+ Person A
  - Merchants
  - Transactions
  - Customers
+ Person B
  - Invoices
  - Items
  - Invoice Items

**Relationship Endpoints**

+ Person A
  - Invoices
  - Items
  - Invoice Items
+ Person B
  - Merchants
  - Transactions
  - Customers

**Business Intelligence Endpoints**

(This portion should be a good starting point for balancing the work. If this seems uneven let the staff know so they can make adjustments.)

+ Person A
  - ```- GET /api/v1/merchants/:id/revenue```
  - ```- GET /api/v1/merchants/:id/revenue?date=x```
  - ```- GET /api/v1/merchants/most_items?quantity=x```
  - ```- GET /api/v1/customers/:id/favorite_merchant```
  - ```- GET /api/v1/items/:id/best_day```
  - ```- GET /api/v1/items/most_items?quantity=x```
+ Person B
  - ```- GET /api/v1/merchants/:id/customers_with_pending_invoices```
  - ```- GET /api/v1/merchants/:id/favorite_customer```
  - ```- GET /api/v1/items/most_revenue?quantity=x```
  - ```- GET /api/v1/merchants/revenue?date=x```
  - ```- GET /api/v1/merchants/most_revenue?quantity=x```

#### Technical Expectations

* All endpoints will expect to return JSON data
* All endpoints should be exposed under an api and version ```(v1)``` namespace (e.g. ```/api/v1/merchants.json```)
* JSON responses should include ```ids``` only for associated records unless otherwise indicated (that is, don’t embed the whole associated record, just the id)
* Prices are in cents, therefore you will need to transform them in dollars. (12345 becomes 123.45)
* Remember that for a JSON string to be valid, it needs to contain a key and a value.

**Data Importing**

* You will create an ActiveRecord model for each entity included in the [sales engine data](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/sales_engine/tree/master/data).
* Your application should include a rake task which imports all of the CSV’s and creates the corresponding records.

#### Record Endpoints

**Index of Record**

Each data category should include an ```index``` action which renders a JSON representation of all the appropriate records:

**Request URL**

```GET /api/v1/merchants.json```

**JSON Output**

(The following is an example of a response if only three records were saved in the database)

```json
[
  {
    "id":1,
    "name":"Schroeder-Jerde"
  },
  {
    "id":2,
    "name":"Klein, Rempel and Jones"
  },
  {
    "id":3,
    "name":"Willms and Sons"
  }
]
```

**Show Record**

Each data category should include a ```show``` action which renders a JSON representation of the appropriate record:

**Request URL**

```GET /api/v1/merchants/1.json```

**JSON Output**

```json
{
  "id":1,
  "name":"Schroeder-Jerde"
}
```

**Single Finders**

Each data category should offer ```find``` finders to return a single object representation. The finder should work with any of the attributes defined on the data type and always be case insensitive.

**Request URL**

```GET /api/v1/merchants/find?parameters```

**Request Parameters**

|parameter | description|
|--------- |----------- |
|id |	search based on the primary key|
|name |	search based on the name attribute|
|created_at |	search based on created_at timestamp|
|updated_at |	search based on updated_at timestamp|

**JSON Output**

```GET /api/v1/merchants/find?name=Schroeder-Jerde```

```json
{  
   "id":1,
   "name":"Schroeder-Jerde"
}
```

**Multi-Finders**

Each category should offer ```find_all``` finders which should return all matches for the given query. It should work with any of the attributes defined on the data type and always be case insensitive.

**Request URL**

```GET /api/v1/merchants/find_all?parameters```

**Request Parameters**

|parameter|description|
|---------|-----------|
|id | search based on the primary key|
|name|	search based on the name attribute|
|created_at|	search based on created_at timestamp|
|updated_at|	search based on updated_at timestamp|

**JSON Output**

```GET /api/v1/merchants/find_all?name=Cummings-Thiel```

```json
[  
   {  
      "id":4,
      "name":"Cummings-Thiel"
   }
]
```

Note: Although this search returns one record, it comes back in an array.

**Random**

**Request URL**

Returns a random resource.

```api/v1/merchants/random.json```

```json
{
  "id": 50,
  "name": "Nader-Hyatt"
}
```

#### Relationship Endpoints

In addition to the direct queries against single resources, we would like to also be able to pull relationship data from the API.

We’ll expose these relationships using nested URLs, as outlined in the sections below.

**Merchants**

* ```GET /api/v1/merchants/:id/items``` returns a collection of items associated with that merchant
* ```GET /api/v1/merchants/:id/invoices``` returns a collection of invoices associated with that merchant from their known orders

**Invoices**

* ```GET /api/v1/invoices/:id/transactions``` returns a collection of associated transactions
* ```GET /api/v1/invoices/:id/invoice_items``` returns a collection of associated invoice items
* ```GET /api/v1/invoices/:id/items``` returns a collection of associated items
* ```GET /api/v1/invoices/:id/customer``` returns the associated customer
* ```GET /api/v1/invoices/:id/merchant``` returns the associated merchant

**Invoice Items**

* ```GET /api/v1/invoice_items/:id/invoice``` returns the associated invoice
* ```GET /api/v1/invoice_items/:id/item``` returns the associated item

**Items**

* ```GET /api/v1/items/:id/invoice_items``` returns a collection of associated invoice items
* ```GET /api/v1/items/:id/merchant``` returns the associated merchant

**Transactions**

* ```GET /api/v1/transactions/:id/invoice``` returns the associated invoice

**Customers**

* ```GET /api/v1/customers/:id/invoices``` returns a collection of associated invoices
* ```GET /api/v1/customers/:id/transactions``` returns a collection of associated transactions

#### Business Intelligence Endpoints

We want to maintain the original Business Intelligence functionality of SalesEngine, but this time expose the data through our API.

Remember that ActiveRecord is your friend. Much of the complicated logic from your original SalesEngine can be expressed quite succinctly using ActiveRecord queries.

**All Merchants**

* ```GET /api/v1/merchants/most_revenue?quantity=x``` returns the top x merchants ranked by total revenue
* ```GET /api/v1/merchants/most_items?quantity=x``` returns the top x merchants ranked by total number of items sold
* ```GET /api/v1/merchants/revenue?date=x``` returns the total revenue for date x across all merchants
Assume the dates provided match the format of a standard ActiveRecord timestamp.

**Single Merchant**

* ```GET /api/v1/merchants/:id/revenue``` returns the total revenue for that merchant across successful transactions
* ```GET /api/v1/merchants/:id/revenue?date=x``` returns the total revenue for that merchant for a specific invoice date x
* ```GET /api/v1/merchants/:id/favorite_customer``` returns the customer who has conducted the most total number of successful transactions.
**BOSS MODE:** ```GET /api/v1/merchants/:id/customers_with_pending_invoices``` returns a collection of customers which have pending (unpaid) invoices. A pending invoice has no transactions with a result of success. This means all transactions are failed. Postgres has an EXCEPT operator that might be useful. ActiveRecord also has a find_by_sql that might help.
_NOTE_: Failed charges should never be counted in revenue totals or statistics.

_NOTE_: All revenues should be reported as a float with two decimal places.

**Items**

* ```GET /api/v1/items/most_revenue?quantity=x``` returns the top x items ranked by total revenue generated
* ```GET /api/v1/items/most_items?quantity=x``` returns the top x item instances ranked by total number sold
* ```GET /api/v1/items/:id/best_day``` returns the date with the most sales for the given item using the invoice date. If there are multiple days with equal number of sales, return the most recent day.

**Customers**

* ```GET /api/v1/customers/:id/favorite_merchant``` returns a merchant where the customer has conducted the most successful transactions
